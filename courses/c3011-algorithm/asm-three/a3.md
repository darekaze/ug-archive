## 1.

The probability of a classroom does not enter by a student is $1-1/n$.

For each classroom $i \in \{1,2,...,n\}$, we can define a indicator random variable, 
$$
X_i = I\{\text{classroom } i\text{ is empty after all } m \text{ students have gone to the classrooms}\}
$$
$$
\text{Therefore, }E[X_i] = Pr\{\text{classroom } i \text{ is empty after all } m \text{ students have gone to the classrooms}\} = (1-1/n)^m
$$

Then, let $X$ be the number of empty classrooms after all student $m$ has gone to the classroom. By linear of expectation, $E[\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i]=\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1-1/n)^m = n\cdot(1-1/n)^m$.

## 2.

If $k = 4$ and the initial of the counter is 0, in this case, if we decrement the counter, it would do 4 flips and the counter will turn from 0000 to 1111. Then, if we increment the counter, it will do another 4 flips and turn from 1111 to 0000. By performing such sequences of increment and decrement for $n/2$ times ($n/2$ increments + $n/2$ decrements), the total amortized cost will be 4n.

Similarly, for $k$-bits binary counter starting from 0, a decrement costs $k$ flips, following up by a increment also costs $k$ flips. Therefore, when performing such sequences of increment and decrement, the amortized cost per operation could be $\Theta(k)$.

## 3.

(a) $l$ is the left boundary of the Z-box. The idea is to maintain an interval $[l, r]$ with max $r$ so that $[l,r]$ is the prefix substring (substring which is also prefix).
