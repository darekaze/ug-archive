## 1.

I have chosen Java 11 as my coding language to implement this algorithm.

To compile the java file, run: `javac LCS16094501D.java`

To execute the program, run: `java LCS16094501D nine singing ninjas`

To test the 

## 2.

The Java program uses bottom-up dynamic programming to find out the LCS of 3 strings (represented as a string).

Based on the Theorem 15.1 from *Lecture 4 Slide 40*, we can extend this to obtain the following recurrence:

Define $c[i,j,k]$ = the length of an LCS of $X_i$, $Y_j$ and $Z_k$, Then:
$$
    c[i,j,k]= 
\begin{cases}
    0,& \text{if } i = 0, j = 0 \text{ or } k = 0\\
    c[i-1,j-1,k-1] + 1, & \text{if } i, j, k \gt 0 \text{ and } x_i = y_j = z_k\\
    max\{c[i-1,j,k], c[i,j-1,k], c[i,j,k-1]\}, & \text{if } i, j, k \gt 0 \text{ and } x_i \neq y_j \neq z_k
\end{cases}
$$

The algorithm's procedures to obtain the LCS of 3 strings are similar to that to obtain from 2 strings. The difference is that the *count* table (*c-table*) and *trace* table (*b-table*) are defined in 3-Dimensional instead of 2-Dimentional, and their values are filled in based on this new recurrence.

Both time complexity and space complexity for this algorithm are $O(|X|\cdot|Y|\cdot|Z|)$. When running the Java program on my laptop (i7-6700HQ, 16GB RAM), the largest input length is around **940** before running out of my memory. In this case, running out of memory is the main issue that terminates the program.

## 3.

One example: Three binary sequences $X = \langle 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\rangle, Y = \langle 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1\rangle, Z = \langle 1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\rangle$

In this case, the LCS of $X, Y, Z$ is $\langle 1,1\rangle$, length = 2, while the LCS of W is $\langle 0,0,0,0,0,0\rangle$. Thus, the LCS of $X \text{ and }W$ is empty, length = 0, which is different from the length of LCS of $X, Y, Z$.

| $n$ | $A(n)$ | $A(n)/n$ |
|-----|--------|----------|
| 20  | 12.9   | 0.645    |
| 50  | 33.8   | 0.6760   |
| 100 | 71.2   | 0.712    |
| 150 | 108.2  | 0.7213   |
| 200 | 145.1  | 0.7255   |
| 400 | 292.6  | 0.7315   |
| 600 | 443.8  | 0.7397   |
| 700 | 514.8  | 0.7354   |
| 800 | 590.9  | 0.7386   |
| 900 | 664.1  | 0.7379   |

(Note: The values of $A(n)/n$ have been rounded to 4 decimal places)

The value of $A(n)/n$ seems to converge to a constant between 0.71 to 0.74 for $100 \leq n \leq 900$ according to my experiments.
