### 1. a)

Using master method with $a = 27$, $b = 3$, and $f(n)={n^2}$, $n^{log_b a} = n^{log_3 27} = n^3$.

Thus, $f(n) = {n^2} = O(n^{log_b a - \epsilon})$ with $\epsilon = 1$.

By case 1 of the master method, $T(n) = \Theta(n^{log_b a}) = \Theta(n^3)$

### 1. b)

The substitution method can be used to show $T(n) = \Theta(n)$:

- ***Upper bound***
  
  Guess: $T(n) = O(n)$

  Assume that $T(n) \leq cn$ for some constant $c > 0$ holds for all positive $m < n$. Then:
  
  $$T(n) = T(2n/3) + T(n^{2/3}) + n \leq 2cn/3 + cn^{2/3} + n$$

  When $c > 3$, $2c/3 + 1 < c$, so for all sufficently large $n$:
  
  $$T(n) = (2c/3 + 1)n + cn^{2/3} \leq cn$$

  Therefore, $T(n) = O(n)$.

- ***Lower bound***
  
  Guess: $T(n) = O(n)$

  Assume that $T(n) \geq cn$ for some constant $c > 0$ holds for all positive $m < n$. Then:
  
  $$T(n) = T(2n/3) + T(n^{2/3}) + n \geq 2cn/3 + cn^{2/3} + n$$

  When $c \leq 3$, $2c/3 + 1 \geq c$, so for all sufficently large $n$:
  
  $$T(n) = (2c/3 + 1)n + cn^{2/3} \geq cn$$

  Therefore, $T(n) = \Omega(n)$.

As $T(n) = O(n)$ and $T(n) = \Omega(n)$, thus $T(n) = \Theta(n)$

### 1. c)

The Iteration method can be used to solve T(n). Through repeating substitution,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  T(n) &= T(n-1)+lg\, n \\
  &= T(n-2)+lg(n-1)+lg\, n \\
  &= T(n-2)+lg[n\cdot(n-1)] \\
  &= ... \\
  &= T(n-k)+lg[n\cdot(n-1)\cdot...\cdot(n-k)]
\end{aligned}
$$

As the base case is $T(1)$, thus $n-1 = k \to k = n + 1$, and substituting this we can get:

$$T(n) = T(1)+lg[n\cdot(n-1)\cdot...\cdot1]$$

As $n\cdot(n-1)\cdot...\cdot1 = n!$, and by Stirling's approximation, $\Theta(lg n!) = \Theta(n\cdot lg n)$. Therefore:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  T(n) &= T(1)+lg\, n! \\
  &= T(1)+\Theta(n\cdot lg\, n) \\
  &= \Theta(n\cdot lg\, n)
\end{aligned}
$$

### 2. Algorithm 1: Find sum of 2018

**Input:** An unsorted list L of negative and positive integers

**Output:** "YES" if there exist three elements $a, b, c \in L$ (with repetitions allowed) such that $a + b + c = 2018$; "NO" otherwise.

```tex
MergeSort(L)                          // O(nlogn)
n = length of L                       // O(1)
for i = 0 to n do                     // O(n)
  start = i
  end = n
  while end > start do                // O(n^2)
    sum = L[i] + L[start] + L[end]
    if sum = 2018 return "YES"
    if sum > 2018 then
      end = end - 1
    else
      start = start + 1
return "NO"                           // O(1)
```

To analyze the running time, Merge Sort takes $O(nlogn)$ time. Operations inside *for* loop takes $O(n)$ while those inside the nested *while* loop takes $O(n^2)$. Other operations outside the loop take $O(1)$ time.

Therefore, by summing up the cost of every line, the time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$.

### 3.

The recurrence relation of multiplying two (4x4) matrices using Divide and Conquer Algorithm with $M$ submatrix multiplications can be shown by this equation:

$$T(n) = MT(n/4) + \Theta(n^2)$$

To find the largest value of constant integer $M$ to get asymptotic improvement over Le Gall's algorightm, which runs in $o(n^{2.37287})$, the recurrence relation can be shown as:

$$T(n) = MT(n/4) + o(n^{2.37287})$$

Using master method with $a = M$ and $b = 4$, $f(n) = n^{2.37287}$, $n^{log_b a} = n^{log_4 M}$.

To satisfy case 1 of the master method, $log_4 M < 2.37287$ such that $f(n) = n^{2.37287} = O(n^{log_4 M - \epsilon})$ with $\epsilon > 0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  log_4 M &< 2.37287 \\
  M &< 26.83 \\
  M &= 26 \space\textrm{(to nearest integer)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the largest value of $M$ is $26$.

### 4.

Using greedy algorithm, this problem can be solved with the following steps:

1. Set $L'$ as an empty array, [ ].
2. Apply Breath-First Search to travel over all nodes in the tree. Then, for each leaf $x \notin L'$, find the unique length of the path from root to leaf $x$. *i.e.* $ulen(x) = |E(L'+x)| - |E(L')|$.
3. For all leaves that is not in $L'$, *i.e.* $e \notin L'$, find leaf $x'$ which have maximum $ulen(x')$.
4. Append $x'$ to $L'$.
5. If $|L'| = l$, return $L'$ as the result. Otherwise, go back to *step 2* and continue the process.

#### Prove the algorithm runs in polynomial time

The number of iterations in the Breath-First Travelsal is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the tree. And we need to perform Breath-First Travelsal for $l$ times to acquire $L'$ with the largest $|E(L')|$ for $|L'| = l$. Therefore, $O(ln)$ is the upper bound on this algorithm's time complexity, which is polynomial in the input size.

#### Prove the correctness of the algorithm

Assume that we have got a leaf set $L'$ based on the above greedy algorithm, and $A$ is one of the possible results such that $|E(A)|$ is the largest. If $A$ can be changed to $L'$ by adding and deleting one leaf correspondingly while remaining $|E(A)|$ unchanged, then we can prove that the algorithm is correct as $|E(A)| = |E(L')|$.

To show this process, let's define $u(x)$ as the number of unique edges contributed by leaf $x$ to $E(A)$, *i.e.*$u(x) = |E(A)| - |E(A-x)|$. Thus, if $L'\subseteq A, ulen(x) \geq u(x)$ holds for any $x$ where $x\notin L'\space\text{and}\space x\in A$.

Starting from $L' = [\space]$, each time when we found a new leaf $x$ which has the largest value of $ulen(x)$, if $x\in A$, then we append $x$ to $L'$. Otherwise, we need to find a leaf $x'$ in $A$ that has the lowest common ancestor(LCA) with $x$.

Then, let $d$ and $d'$ be the distance between $x$ and LCA, and the distance between $x'$ and LCA respectively. If $x'\notin L'$, it can be proven that $d' \leq d$ as $ulen(x') < ulen(x)$, thus $|E(A-x'+x)| = |E(A)|-x'+x\geq |E(A)|$. And $x'$ in $A$ can be replaced by $x$ while maintaining $|E(A)|$ unchanged. Otherwise, we need to find an arbitrary leaf $a$ such that $a\in A$ but $a\notin L'$. Similarly, as $u(a)\leq ulen(a)\leq ulen(x) = d, |E(A-a+x)| = |E(a)|-u(a)+ulen(x)\geq |E(A)|$. Thus, we can replace $a$ in $A$ with $x$ and append $x$ into $L'$.

As $x\in A$ and $L'\subseteq A$ still holds, repeat the process until $A$ is totally changed to $L'$.
