      <h2>Go Shopping</h2>
      <p>From cutting edge electronics to colorful anime goods, traditional crafts, trendy fashion and branded goods, <strong>Tokyo</strong> has a shop for practically anything one could ever want to buy - although not necessarily in your desired price range.</p>
      <p>Tokyo's varied sightseeing districts double as shopping districts, many of them with their own character and specialties. The following is a general rundown of what to expect on the shopping scene of each district so you can familiarize and prepare yourself for a shopping spree in the big city.</p>

      <h3>Shinjuku - One of Tokyo's largest shopping and entertainment districts</h3>

      <p>Centered around <strong>Shinjuku</strong> Station, a major transportation hub and the busiest train station in the world, this district is home to half a dozen major department stores, including several companies' flagship stores; as well as outlets of Japan's largest electronics retailers combined with a host of other shops and boutiques along its streets and underground shopping arcades.</p>

      <p>Around <strong>Shibuya</strong> Station is another large shopping district that is the birthplace of many of Japan's youth fashion trends. It is home to some well known, trend setting clothing stores such as Shibuya 109, as well as dozens of small fashion stores along its streets. Small boutiques, including high fashion and designer brands, continue to be found through to Aoyama and Daikanyama where the atmosphere is more subdued compared to the electric brightness of Shibuya.</p>
