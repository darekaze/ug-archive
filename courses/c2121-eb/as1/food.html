      <h2>Dining?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Tokyo</strong></a> is one of the world's most exciting dining destinations. The city features a wide range 
        of both local and regional <strong>Japanese cuisine</strong> in addition to all types of international fare. Its top 
        restaurants have accrued more Michelin stars than both Paris and New York combined. But good food can be found at every 
        price range from cheap hole-in-the-wall joints to expensive high-class restaurants with every budget in between.

            <h3>Nigiri-zushi</h3>
            <p>
                The most popular type of sushi today, <em>nigiri-zushi</em> originated as a fast-food dish in Tokyo. Consisting of a 
                piece of seafood put onto a small ball of rice, it takes much less time and effort to prepare than more traditional 
                sushi dishes. Nigiri-zushi are served at all sushi restaurants from inexpensive conveyor belt sushi to Michelin-starred 
                restaurants. The Tsukiji Outer Market is one of the best places to eat fresh sushi.

            <h3>Tempura</h3>
            <p>
                Another of Japan's most famous dishes, tempura also underwent major development in the capital city. Before the Edo Period, 
                mainly vegetables were used for tempura, but Edo cooks started to deep fry seafood from Edo Bay in tempura batter, resulting 
                in the more varied dish we know today. A visit to a specialized tempura restaurant (tempura-ya) is the recommended way to enjoy tempura.

            <h3>Soba</h3>
            <p>
                Soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) are a popular dish in many regions of Japan. In Tokyo, they were particularly popular during the Edo Period, 
                and can be found all across the city today, including at standing soba eateries and establishments specialized in soba (soba-ya). The dipping 
                sauce used in Tokyo is traditionally relatively thick, and diners are encouraged to dip their noodles into it only lightly.
