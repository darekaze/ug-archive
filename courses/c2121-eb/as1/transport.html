    <h2>Orientation</h2>
      <p><strong>Tokyo</strong> is covered by a dense network of <strong>train</strong>, <strong>subway</strong> and
        <strong>bus</strong>
        lines, which are operated by about a dozen different companies. The train lines operated by JR East and the
        subway lines are most convenient for moving around central Tokyo.</p>

      <p>Tokyo's most prominent train line is the <em>JR Yamanote Line</em>, a loop line which connects
        Tokyo's multiple city centers. The city's 13 subway lines are operated by two companies and run largely inside
        the Yamanote circle and the areas around <em>Ginza</em> and the area east of the loop line.
        Most of the many suburban train lines commence at one of the six major stations of the <em>Yamanote
          Line</em> (Tokyo, Ueno, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya and Shinagawa).</p>


      <h3>Major JR train lines in Central Tokyo</h3>

      <p>The map shows Tokyo's major railway stations and the five JR lines that are most relevant to people who travel
        within central Tokyo.</p>

      <ol>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          <font color="00ff00"><b>Yamanote Line</b></font>
          <br>Circle line that connects all major city centers.
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <p></p>
        <li>
          <font color="00ffff"><b>Keihin-Tohoku Line</b></font>
          <br>Runs parallel to the Yamanote Line on the eastern half of the circle.
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <p></p>
        <li>
          <font color="cccc00"><b>Chuo/Sobu Line (Local)</b></font>
          <br>Runs across the Yamanote circle (local slow service).
        </li>
        <p></p>

          <font color="ff7700"><b>Chuo Line (Rapid)</b></font>
          <br>Runs across the Yamanote circle (rapid service). Connects <i>Tokyo Station</i> with <em>Shinjuku Station</em>.
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <p></p>
        <li>
          <font color="008800"><b>Saikyo Line</b></font>
          <br>Runs parallel to the Yamanote Line on the western half of the circle. From Osaki Station, some trains
          continue running along the Rinkai Line in direction of <i>Odaiba</i>.
        </li>
        <p></p>

        <p></p>
        <li>
          <font color="ff0000"><b>Shinkansen</b></font>
          <br>Tokaido Shinkansen trains stop at Tokyo and <i>Shinagawa</i>, while bullet trains to

        </li>
        <p></p>
      </ol>

      <h3>Subways</h3>

      <p>Tokyo's subway network is operated by two companies, the Toei Subways with four lines, and <strong>Tokyo 
        Metro</strong> (formerly known as Eidan Subways) with nine lines. Together, they densely cover central Tokyo,
        especially the area inside the Yamanote circle and the areas around <em>Ginza</em> and the area
        east of the loop line.</p>

      <p>Note, that at their terminal stations, the trains of some subway lines continue to operate on the tracks of
        different companies on suburban train lines. For example, the Chiyoda Subway Line is directly connected with
        the suburban Odakyu Line at Yoyogi-Uehara Station, and trains on the Fukutoshin Subway Line continue to run on
        the tracks of the Tokyu Toyoko Line at Shibuya Station.</p>
