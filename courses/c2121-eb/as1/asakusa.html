      <h2>Asakusa?</h2>
      <p>
        Asakusa (浅草) is the center of Tokyo's shitamachi (literally "low city"), one of Tokyo's districts, 
        where an atmosphere of the Tokyo of past decades survives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Asakusa's main attraction is <em><a href="http://www.senso-ji.jp/" target="_blank">Sensoji</a></em>, a very popular Buddhist temple, built in the 7th century.
        The temple is approached via the <em>Nakamise</em>, a shopping street that has been providing temple 
        visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks and tourist souvenirs for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
          For many centuries, Asakusa used to be Tokyo's leading entertainment district. During the <em>Edo Period</em> (1603-1867), 
          when the district was still located outside the city limits, Asakusa was the site of <em>kabuki</em> theaters and a large 
          red light district. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, modern types of entertainment, including movie theaters, set foot in Asakusa.

      </div>
      <p>
          However, large parts of Asakusa were destroyed in the air raids of World War Two. And while the area around the rebuilt 
          <em><a href="http://www.senso-ji.jp/" target="_blank">Sensoji</a></em> has regained its former popularity after the war, the same cannot 
          be said for Asakusa's entertainment district. The opening of the 634 meter tall <em><a href="http://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/" target="_blank">Tokyo Skytree</a></em>, 
          a twenty minute walk across the Sumida River from Asakusa, has led to an increase of tourists recently.
