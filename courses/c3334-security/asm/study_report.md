Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the biggest trends in recent years. This new technology has been widely adopted in many different application domains such as logistics and marketings, and one of its most important integrations is towards cyber-security.

Cyber crimes happen everyday in our real life through e-mail, phone call, social media etc., and this trend keeps evolving and may threaten people's lives as well as their properties. To fight against cyber criminals, spam filter has been invented to help prevent malicious and unsolicited information reaching to potential victims. With the integrations of AI, modern spam filter has evolved and become more effective and powerful in detecting and filtering out suspicious and junk messages before they reach to the victims.

This report will mainly discuss the AI's contributions to cyber-security by studying different practical applications of AI-integrated spam filters.

## E-mails

E-mail services have been commonly used not only for personal communication, but also for commercial advertisement in today's world. The high usage of e-mail has stimulated several cyber-security threats caused by spam e-mails, which include viruses, phishing messages, fraud schemes, explicit contents etc. (Bhowmick & Hazarika, 2018). To address these issues, Google Mail (GMail), one of the largest e-mail service providers (ESP), has integrated AI technology into its spam filter to protect its users from being victimized by cyber criminals ([4]).

The techniques used by e-mail spam filter can be categorized into two different types: the traditional SMTP approach and the newer machine learning approach, which the later uses machine learning classifier to detect whether the e-mail is spam or legitimate. It is consider to be more efficient and has more popularity as it can learn the patterns and the changes of the new spamming techniques automatically time by time, without manually configuring by humans ([1]).

The machine learning spam filtering techniques can be further subcategories into content based and non-content based. For content based, the machine learning algorithm used varies base on its type. For example, *Naive Bayes Classifier* or *Support Vector Machine* (SVM) is used in text based contents to filter contents such as phishing messages and fraud schemes ([1]), while *Back Propagation Neural Networks* is used in image base contents to filter contents such as sexual images ([3]). For non-content based, *N-Grams Algorithm* is used to classify the e-mail based on the e-mail header, which consist of information such as the sender server IP address and the mail subject ([2]). This can prevent email abusing behaviors such as spambot attack and email bombing attack.

## Voice Call

Similar to e-mail, voice call is widely used for both personal communication and commercial activity. And this platform is targeted by  cyber criminals such as scammers and . With the rise of VoIP, ....

traditional phone call and voip

voice recognition, transcript NLP, filter.

## Social Media (don't need to talk too much)

Similar technique mentioned in email part

Just give examples

## Future

develop  New era to fight back spammer , wasting their time

An interesting one to mention: Re:Scam by Netsafe

## Conclusion

AI: collecting data, big data, artificial neutral network, evolving technics
