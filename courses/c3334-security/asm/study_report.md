Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the biggest trends in recent years. This new technology has been widely adopted in many different application domains such as logistics and marketings, and one of its most important integrations is towards cyber-security.

Cyber crimes happen everyday in our real life through e-mail, phone call, social media etc., and this trend keeps evolving and may threaten people's lives as well as their properties. To fight against cyber criminals, spam filter has been invented to help prevent malicious and unsolicited information reaching to potential victims. With the integrations of AI, modern spam filter has evolved and become more effective and powerful in detecting and filtering out suspicious and junk messages before they reach to the victims.

This report will mainly discuss the AI's contributions to cyber-security by studying different practical applications of AI-integrated spam filters.

## E-mails

E-mail services have been commonly used not only for personal communication, but also for commercial advertisement in today's world. The high usage of e-mail has stimulated several cyber-security threats caused by spam e-mails, which include viruses, phishing messages, fraud schemes, explicit contents etc..(Bhowmick & Hazarika, 2018) To address these issues, e-mail service providers, such as Google and Microsoft, create and customize their own spam filter to protect their users from being victimized by cyber criminals.
