## Paper Summary

The paper examines the **crosstab-based statistical method**, which applies an explicit statistical analysis model to perform automated *Fault localization*. 

In the **crosstab** analysis model, a **crosstab** is composed for each executable statement to reflect their suspiciousness. By running a hypothesis test involving computations of $\chi$-square test, contingency coefficient $m$, and statistic $\zeta$ to each **crosstab**, a suspiciousness index $\zeta$ can be obtained for each of them. The statement with the highest suspiciousness index is being inspected first.

Experiment results indicate **crosstab** performs more effectively than other techniques in detecting faults, and it operates as efficiently as *Tarantula*.
