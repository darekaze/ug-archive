## Paper Summary

The paper examines five different techniques for performing automated *Fault localization*, the most expensive debugging activity, and evaluates the performance of *Tarantula* based on the effectiveness and efficiency rankings among the five.

*Tarantula* technique is based on getting correlations between test-case outcomes and execution events. Events corresponding advantageously with failure are being inspected first.

The result indicates *Tarantula* outperforms other techniques consistently regarding effectiveness and has similar costs to the most efficient techniques. Under the same score-level, it can identify noticeably more faults. However, the proportion that does not required to be analyzed in the program is concerned.
