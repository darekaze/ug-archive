### 1. a)

Using master method with $a = 27$, $b = 3$, and $f(n)={n^2}$, $n^{log_b a} = n^{log_3 27} = n^3 $.

Thus, $f(n) = {n^2} = O(n^{log_b a - \epsilon})$ with $\epsilon = 1$.

By case 1 of the master method, $T(n) = \Theta(n^{log_b a}) = \Theta(n^3)$

### 1. b)

TBD

### 1. c)

The Iteration method can be used to solve T(n). Through repeating substitution,

$$
\begin{aligned}
 T(n) &= T(n-1)+lg\, n \\
 &= T(n-2)+lg(n-1)+lg\, n \\
 &= T(n-2)+lg[n\cdot(n-1)] \\
 &= ... \\
 &= T(n-k)+lg[n\cdot(n-1)\cdot...\cdot(n-k)]
\end{aligned}
$$

As the base case is $T(1)$, thus $n-1 = k \to k = n + 1$, and substituting this we can get:

$$T(n) = T(1)+lg[n\cdot(n-1)\cdot...\cdot1]$$

As $n\cdot(n-1)\cdot...\cdot1 = n!$, and by Stirling's approximation, $\Theta(lg n!) = \Theta(n\cdot lg n)$, thus:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 T(n) &= T(1)+lg\, n! \\
 &= T(1)+\Theta(n\cdot lg\, n) \\
 &= \Theta(n\cdot lg\, n)
\end{aligned}
$$

Pseudocode of my algorithm:

```tex
Algorithm 1: Find sum of 2018
---
Input: An unsorted list L of negative and positive integers
Output: "YES" if there exist three elements a, b, c âˆˆ L (with repetitions allowed) such that a + b + c = 2018; "NO" otherwise.

MergeSort(L)                          // O(nlogn)
n = length of L                       // O(1)
for i = 0 to n do                     // O(n)
  start = i
  end = n
  while end > start do                // O(n^2)
    sum = L[i] + L[start] + L[end]
    if sum = 2018 return "YES"
    if sum > 2018 then
      end = end - 1
    else
      start = start + 1
return "NO"                           // O(1)
```

To analyze the running time, Merge Sort takes $O(nlogn)$ time. Operations inside *for* loop takes $O(n)$ while those inside the nested *while* loop takes $O(n^2)$. Other operations outside the loop take $O(1)$ time.

Therefore, by summing up the cost of every line, the time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2)$.

### 3.

The recurrence relation of multiplying two (4x4) matrices with $M$ submatrix multiplications can be shown by this equation:

$$T(n) = MT(n/4) + \Theta(n^2)$$

To find the largest value of constant integer $M$ to get asymptotic improvement over Le Gall's algorightm, which runs in $o(n^{2.37287})$, the recurrence relation can be shown as:

$$T(n) = MT(n/4) + o(n^{2.37287})$$

Using master method with $a = M$ and $b = 4$, $f(n) = n^{2.37287}$, $n^{log_b a} = n^{log_4 M}$.

To satisfy case 1 of the master method, $log_4 M < 2.37287$ such that $f(n) = n^{2.37287} = O(n^{log_4 M - \epsilon})$ with $\epsilon > 0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  log_4 M &< 2.37287 \\
  M &< 26.83 \\
  M &= 26 \space\textrm{(to nearest integer)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the largest value of $M$ is $26$.

Ideas:

Do BFT to get the depth and parent nodes of every leaves path. O(|V|+|E|)

Sort the leaves by the level of depth (deaper first). O(|L|log(|L|))

Loop through every leaves, record the unique edges and get the number of unique length of edge. O(|L|*|E|)? = O(n^2)

Sort again by number of unique length of edge. O(|L|log(|L|))

l loop to get the subset. O(l)
